About Shooting Distance

Depending on the distance from the monster and where the arrow was released, the damage may increase or decrease.

-Short Range (yellow circle): Damage from charged attacks will decrease slightly

-Critical Distance (orange circle): Damage is at its maximum

-Long Range (yellow circle): Damage will be 1

-Outside Range (OUTSIDE OF RANGE): Arrow doesn't connect (one hit of Wyvern's Arrow may connect)

-Quick Shot has a short shooting distance. Damage will be 1 if you are further than 1 roll away.
